A Discord bot for helping to keep track of the experience of multiple "characters" per user!

Please note that this bot, while mostly feature complete, is likely riddled with smaller issues, as comprehensive
testing has yet to be undertaken. If you stumble across this and decide to use it for personal use, or borrow code from
it, please understand that you do so at your own risk. I will not be able to provide support for forks or clones of
this project.

The intended use case for this bot is in conjunction with role-playing over text. No functionality to support time spent
in voice chats will be added. Pull requests to add this functionality will be denied. It is out of scope for this bot.

This bot was developed by myself, Discord@dusk_argentum, specifically for use on the Northern Lights Province Discord
server. While this bot does (mostly) support being added to other servers, it may not perform as well without changes.
